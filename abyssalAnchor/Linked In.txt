About

I have 8 years of research experience in quantum physics and computer science throughout various institutions which include the following focuses:

▸Mapping non-planar molecules to quantum circuits
▸Home-brewed variational quantum eigensolver for ground state energy calculation
▸Entangled quantum key distribution networks for distributed cryptographic proof
▸Topological quantum neural networks for the problem of generalization

Currently I lead a subset of the quantum research division at BTQ, which focuses on the application of quantum computing and optimization techniques to real world problems such as communication and cryptography. 

I am also a Master's researcher in the department of physics at the University of Victoria where I research the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis across non-integrable quantum many-body systems using quantum algorithms and computational techniques. The areas of research I have experience in include: 

▸Quantum computing
▸Quantum cryptography
▸Quantum information theory
▸Quantum gravity
▸Complexity theory
▸Post-quantum cryptography
▸Quantum optics
▸Cosmology
▸Medical physics
▸Electrical engineering
▸Photonics
▸Astrophysics

I hope to improve people's lives by researching real world problems with mathematics and physics.

Developed topological quantum neural networks to enhance generalization in deep learning and improve the efficiency of quantum algorithms. This approach leveraged concepts from topological quantum field theory to model and optimize the flow of information in quantum systems, offering scalable solutions for quantum computing tasks. Furthermore, when describing a topological quantum neural network, the network evolves no longer evolves a black box but instead a sum over probability distributions, i.e. the different ways topological/global learning can occur in a neural network.

Explored how topological wormholes impact the entanglement structure of qubits in quantum systems, providing insights for quantum computing. By analyzing quantum tunneling events and their relationship to wormhole geometries, we identified ways to enhance the global connectivity and stability of quantum networks. These findings help pave the way for more robust quantum algorithms and architectures by leveraging the unique properties of quantum entanglement and non-local dynamics.

    Investigated the challenges of finding stable de Sitter solutions in string theory and their relevance to modeling our universe. We analyzed how quantum effects could modify geometric structures to bypass theoretical constraints, focusing on compact spaces that simplify higher-dimensional physics into observable phenomena. These insights contribute to understanding the foundations of quantum gravity and the potential for integrating string theory into practical quantum technologies.

    Developed numerical models to identify cosmic string signals embedded in non-linear cosmological noise, simulating energy densities from early-universe phase transitions. By implementing match-filtering techniques in Python, we demonstrated their effectiveness in detecting these signals to leading order. This work explored the stability and evolution of cosmic strings through quantum field theories, providing insights into their formation conditions and the structure of the early universe.

    Explored the efficiency of photon-recycling propulsion systems, focusing on momentum transfer in macroscopic aerospace applications. By studying quantum effects, including light interactions and radiation pressure, we found that these phenomena do not reduce the system’s overall efficiency. This work also examined the role of quantum corrections, such as interference patterns and the Casimir effect, in optimizing photon-based propulsion. These insights have broader implications for quantum technologies, where efficient energy transfer and manipulation of light are critical.

    Analyzed scintillation patterns in fast radio bursts (FRBs) to understand their connection to black-white hole tunneling events. Using Python, we processed FRB signals captured by the CHIME telescope, decoupling them from non-linear radio noise to study spatial correlations. By correcting propagation and beam effects through dedispersion and beam analyses, we computed key parameters like scintillation and decorrelation bandwidths, improving the accuracy of signal characterization for astrophysical studies.
