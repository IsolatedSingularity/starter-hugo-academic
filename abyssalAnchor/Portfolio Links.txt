Notes:
    - Since Linked In has privacy features that might prevent the agent of getting info of, a full text version of my Linked In profile in the form of a text file is included.
    - Furthermore, since the agent can't read PDFs, I've also included my resume in the form of a tex file.
    - The qLDPC Reference folder is ONLY for refining aspects of the QLDPC circuit builder repository (https://github.com/btq-ag/QLDPC).
    - Never use em dashes. Use regular dashes or rewrite the sentence.
    - In code, always use camelCase (variableName) instead of snake_case (variable_name) if applicable.
