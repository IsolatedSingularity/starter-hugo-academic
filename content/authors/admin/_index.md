I am a recent graduate from the BSc honours physics program at [McGill University](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/) in Montréal, Canada.

My research background spans six years throughout various universities and institutions ranging from string theory to quantum information theory. I am currently working with [Prof. Igor Boettcher](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~iboettch/) on the holographic entanglement structure of qubits in quantum mechanics. I also have had the pleasure of working with [Prof. Robert Brandenberger](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~rhb/) on topological defect signals in inflationary cosmology, with [Prof. Keshav Dasgupta](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~keshav/) on de Sitter compactifications in type II string theory,  and [Prof. Simon Caron-Huot](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~schuot/) & [Prof. Andrew Higgins](https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/people/staff/andrewhiggins) on the interaction of light in photon recycling via scalar quantum field theory, to name a few. My interests are deeply rooted in theoretical high energy physics, such as quantum gravity and topological quantum information theory.

When my soul isn't being consumed by physics, it's being devoured by a black hole. Also I hike & cook.
