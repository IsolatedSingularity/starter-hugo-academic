I am a recent graduate from the BSc honours physics program at [McGill University](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/) in Montréal, Canada. I start an MSc in theoretical physics at the [University of Victoria](https://www.uvic.ca/) in the following year.

My research background spans seven years in theoretical physics and data science throughout various universities ranging from string theory to quantum cryptography. I am currently working with [Prof. Antonino Marcianò](https://phys.fudan.edu.cn/f7/88/c7605a63368/page.htm) and [Prof. Emanuele Zappala](https://eazappala.com/) on the link between quantum neural networks and topological quantum field theory for more efficient quantum computation. Simultaneously, I am doing research with [Dr. Peter Rohde](https://peterrohde.org/) on optimizing robust consensus protocols in post-quantum cryptograpy using persistent homology and topological data analysis techniques. My previous research was under [Prof. Igor Boettcher](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~iboettch/) on the holographic entanglement structure of topological wormholes with quantum computing theory. My interests are deeply rooted in unraveling intricate problems, whether it's describing our universe with quantum gravity or brain networks with topology.

When my soul isn't being consumed by physics, it's being devoured by black holes. Also I hike & cook.
