I am a recent graduate from the BSc honours physics program at [McGill University](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/) in Montréal, Canada.

My research background spans six years in theoretical physics and data science throughout various universities ranging from string theory to quantum computing theory. I am currently working with [Prof. Igor Boettcher](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~iboettch/) on the holographic entanglement structure of wormholes with quantum information theory. I've also had the pleasure of working with [Prof. Keshav Dasgupta](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~keshav/) on de Sitter compactifications in M-theory and [Prof. Robert Brandenberger](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~rhb/) on topological defect signals in inflationary string cosmology, to name a few. My interests are deeply rooted in unraveling intricate problems, whether its describing our universe with quantum gravity or brain networks with topology.

When my soul isn't being consumed by physics, it's being devoured by black holes. Also I hike & cook.
