summary: |+
  **Bachelor's Thesis.** Study of the problematic non-existence of vacua with de Sitter isometries occurring in type II superstring theory. Used generalized coherent states over super Minkowski space with these isometries for non-singular compactifications to the de Sitter spacetime, a candidate to model our Lorentzian universe.
