  **Bachelor's Thesis.** Study of the problematic non-existence of vacua with de Sitter isometries occurring in type II superstring theory. We look at excited Glauber-Sudarshan (product coherent) states over super Minkowski space with these isometries to allow for non-singular compactifications to the de Sitter spacetime, a candidate to model our Lorentzian universe.
  
  **Supervisor:** [Prof. Robert Brandenberger](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/~rhb/).
