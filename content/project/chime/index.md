  Characterized the statistics of fast radio burst repeater signals for modelling their corresponding black-white hole tunnelling events. Numerically computed scintillation and decorrelation densities of signals in the direction of the M81 galaxy group amongst non-linear cosmological noise with the CHIME/Pulsar system.
